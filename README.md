# tests-render-engine
This used to be where example programs I'd created with [render-engine](https://github.com/cynic64/render-engine) were stored, but they've been moved to within the render-engine repo to keep changes with the underlying library in sync with the examples. There's a couple links that point to this repo, so I don't want to delete it entirely.

See the `examples` directory in the [render-engine](https://github.com/cynic64/render-engine) repo for where these have been moved to.
